# Project Name

GPT -> PDF Chat

After seeing much desire for a GPT chatbot that uses your own PDFs, I decided to code this project. I hope you enjoy it!

## Installation

All you need to set up this project is add your OPEN_AI_API key as an env variable, or copy it in plain text on line 13 of the .py file

## Usage

To use the project, save the PDF's you want to query to your C drive (developed on a windows machine, if you wish to change this, you can edit line 53 and 56 to have to PDF uploader pull from whatever dir you like by replacing the 'C:/'). Once you have uploaded your PDFs, refresh the browser, select a manual, and ask away!

## History

WORK IN PROGRESS

Currently the .py file is all you need to produce the functionality shown in the video. Manual/PDF selection is not working as of yet, but due to the questions about how to make this work I wanted to provide some source code for the time being. Follow for updates as I change this project into something that allows you to run locally and upload your PDFs, then select them on the sidebar as you wish. Thanks!
