Currently the .py file is all you need to produce the functionality shown in the video. Manual/PDF selection is not working as of yet, but due to the questions about how to make this work I wanted to provide some source code for the time being. Follow for updates as I change this project into something that allows you to run locally and upload your PDFs, then select them on the sidebar as you wish. Thanks!
